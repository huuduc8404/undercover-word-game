# Websocket Server Implementation Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the websocket server implementation for the Undercover Word Game, allowing players to connect from different networks.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a client-server architecture using Socket.IO:

1. **Server**: A Node.js server with Socket.IO that manages game rooms, player connections, and game state synchronization.
2. **Client**: The React frontend modified to use Socket.IO instead of PeerJS for communication.
3. **Tunneling**: Using ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the server to the internet.

## Key Components

### Server-Side
- **Game Room Management**: Creating, joining, and managing game rooms
- **Player Management**: Tracking players, handling connections/disconnections
- **Game State Synchronization**: Broadcasting game state updates to all players
- **Event Handling**: Processing game events (votes, descriptions, etc.)

### Client-Side
- **WebSocketContext**: Replacing PeerContext with Socket.IO-based context
- **Connection Management**: Handling connections, reconnections, and disconnections
- **Game State Updates**: Sending and receiving game state updates
- **UI Updates**: Modifying the MultiplayerSetup component for the new architecture

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the server project structure
2. Implement the server-side components
3. Modify the client-side code to use Socket.IO
4. Set up environment configuration
5. Configure tunneling for internet access

## Benefits Over Current Implementation

1. **Better Network Compatibility**: Works across different networks, NATs, and firewalls
2. **Centralized State Management**: Server maintains the source of truth for game state
3. **Improved Reliability**: Better handling of disconnections and reconnections
4. **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent games and players
5. **Simplified Client Logic**: Clients only need to connect to the server, not to each other

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development**: Run the server locally with ngrok for testing
2. **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure (VPS, home server, etc.)
3. **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the server according to the detailed plan in `websocket-server-implementation-plan.md`
2. Test the implementation locally
3. Deploy to your chosen infrastructure
4. Configure tunneling for internet access

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for allowing players to connect from different networks, improving the game's accessibility and reliability. The detailed implementation plan in `websocket-server-implementation-plan.md` provides step-by-step instructions for creating both the server and client components.
